  <p>
    Because I'm a terrible illustrator, I've always used whatever help I can get
    to produce artwork&mdash;until November 2022, this generally meant using
    stock images in conjunction with Photoshop and Illustrator to excerpt and
    colorize.
  </p>

  <p>
    As with many other creatives, AI has been a game-changer for me. But instead
    of using it to create illustrations that are far outside of my technical
    grasp, I use it as a helper and use it to create drawings in my own style.
  </p>

  <p>Here are a few pointers:</p>

  <p>
    <span class="h4">Prompt help</span>You can use A.I. or even a Google search
    to help create prompts. I used ChatGPT to help create Zorgon, but first I
    used Google to learn the phrase "rubber hose animation," a phrase I didn't
    know before although I'd certainly seen enough of it. That's why Zorgon has
    such great arms and legs.
  </p>
  <p>
    <span class="h4">Color library</span>
    If you have a color palette you want to use for a group of illustrations, create
    a project and save that color palette in the instructions for the project.
  </p>

  <p>
    <img
      src="img-blog/17th-century-spaghetti-dinner.png"
      class="secondary"
    /><span class="h4">Be aware of context, historical and otherwise</span>
    I asked ChatGPT to paint a group of 17th century Americans eating a spaghetti
    dinner. A human artist might have asked me whether I meant colonists or Native
    Americans. They might have questioned my choice of a menu that was unavailable
    in 17th century America. Finally, a human artist may have asked the men to remove
    their hats before sitting down to dinner.
  </p>

  <p>
    <span class="h4">Count fingers and toes</span>As of this writing you still
    ought to count fingers, toes, legs, and arms.
  </p>

  <p>
    <span class="h4">Add your own touches in editing</span>
    For Friday Goody Bag, I ask ChatGPT (currently using 4.0) to create images in
    black and white. I then colorize them in Photoshop, using a limited color palette
    to give them consistency. I also sometimes erase and redraw parts of them because
    it makes them messier and more like my personal drawing style. Develop your own
    "cheat code" to make the images yours, and they'll slowly shine with your personal
    style.
